- authors mentioned that geometric repeatability of a local feature is not enough. Geometric repeatability refers to the characteristic that 2 related patches have similar descriptors. The loss must include a discriminative part as well ([[Annotations/AffNet#^0yzrrxs938j]])
- Introduced the hard negative-constant loss, a combination of the triplet and contrastive positive loss. It treats the distance to the hardest negative example as constant (=no derivative), ie the example which is most probable to be confused as a positive match. The loss is minimal if positive pairs have a distance of zero and negative pairs a distance of >1 ([[Annotations/AffNet#^w36kec9tjx]]). This new loss yields in a better distribution of the descriptors in space.
- Train with UBC Phototour dataset and verify patches by 3d reconstruction model ([[Annotations/AffNet#^9wxr8dhzgm7]])
- Training: Affine transform corresponding patches, which will go through AffNet, which acts as a orientation estimator. Use the output of AffNet to warp patches into an estimated canonical shape by a SpatialTransformer. The aligned patches are described and a nxn distance matrix is calculated ([[Annotations/AffNet#^1bjdklb7mlt]])
