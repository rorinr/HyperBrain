# Hand-crafted vs. Learned features
Hand-crafted features in image matching are manually designed and engineered based on domain knowledge, while learned features are automatically learned from data through Machine Learning (find proper source here).
# Image Matching
Image Matching or wide multiple baseline stereo (WxBS) is a process of establishing a sufficient number of pixel or region correspondences from two or more images depicting the same scene to estimate the geometric relationship between cameras, which produced these images (https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-matching).




-------------------------------------------
#### High vs. low level image information

#### dense matchers vs. sparse matchers

#### ransac vs lo-ransac 

#### - detect-than-described, described-than-detected, or both together

#### Contrast filtering and non-maximum suppression

#### Different approaches: Images with labeled keypoints (supervised), Alligned images with contrastive learning (supervised), single image with augmentations (unsupervised)

#### Hard-mining/Hard negative mining

#### Triplet Loss vs contrastive loss

### Usage of different images of same object (eg through structure from motion dataset) or just using one image and transform patch-based

### Using an separate orientation network or not
