- Replace the complicated masking step in get_coarse_matches with torch.nonzero with yields in same result
- masking or no masking
- What happens when skipping the masking step at test time as well?
- focal vs dual softmax loss
- Weight loss of positive patches greater if there are only a few positives in a match
- 8/2 vs 16/4
- different kinds of attention
- soft labels
- other kind of backbone
- other dimensions
- use coarse level features as context in finetuning preprocessing
- use std in fine loss or not
- use mutual criteria in ground truth that center pixel of patch i is in path j and also center pixel of patch j in patch i or just one way
- since it is used softmax for refinement as well one could try nll there instead of l2
