- What is SOTA? Would you trust the paperswithcode leaderboard?
- Unsupervised possible?
- Gap between natural images and medical images? 

## Draft
I just started my master thesis. In this i will train a deep learning image matching model on medical data. To be more precise I have to put successive brain scans on top of each other; to reconstruct a digital 3D-brain from 2D-brain scans (The next step, after image matching, is image registration for finetuning. In my thesis it is just image matching). The images are really high-dimensional (140,000Â²), so I will work patch-wise. I am currently reading the latest research to this topic and found yours as well. I have a few questions and it would be great if you could answer these:
1. Do you think that there is a large gap in performance between natural images (like IMC PhotoTourism dataset) and medical images?
2. I didnt find an unsupervised approach for image matching, ie finding corresponding keypoints of two images without having a noted dataset. Is it even possible?
3. Following the leaderboard of paperswithcode, there are some models better than others. How reliable do you think is this leaderboard? I was very surprised to see RootSift there, a 2012 model that performs better than many DeepLearning approaches.
