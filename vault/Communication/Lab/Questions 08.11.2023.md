- Is it okay to work with Pawel Swoboda?
- One challenge is how to match these extreme large images
- I still need access to the Supercomputer!
- Train from scratch vs. using existing feature extractor for medical images
- When start to code and train the first models? There is a lot of literature and i could simply read papers about image matching the next 3 months. Better idea to just start at one point?
- https://kornia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications/image_matching.html as first attempt
- loftr my fav so far, superpoint+superglue (always in combination) works iff we are able to find augmentations that work. 
- Further reading which is relevant in my opinion: ASpanFormer, LightGlue and CasMTR
- Multiple modalities: Should this model handle multiple modalities from the beginning? Or is cyto enough for a first test?
- How it goes on: I will read 2-3 more papers, talk to Pawel (if okay) and start the first implementations
