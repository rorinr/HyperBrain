- Hand-crafted vs. Learned features
	- [[Methodology#Hand-crafted vs. Learned features]]
- Approaches
	- Dataset, mostly used SfM in order to get point correspondences
	- Supervised vs. Unsupervised
	- Contrastive learning, Learning through augmentations etc.
	- First CNN approaches, then problem with CNN-approaches (see nikoalaos paper) then transformer
- Cluster the read literature into similar approaches using properties like loss, keypoint-describe in one shot or multiple shots, do they actually compute keypoints, do they use 3d reconstructions for ground truth etc.
- Explain paper which are suitable for Problem
